- annotated data in CAT-XML format (folder: annotated_data). To visualise the data, you have to use CAT (Content Annotation Tool: http://dh.fbk.eu/resources/cat-content-annotation-tool). Ask for a n account, it's free.
- annotated data in evaluation format, extending PLOT_LINK relations to include coreference relations (folder: evaluation_format)
- test data (folder: evaluation_format/test)
- Python3.* scripts for creating the evaluation format of the data, extracting baselines systems, evaluating baselines'output

The corpus is still growing. Different versions will be made available in this repository as soon as they are ready.
